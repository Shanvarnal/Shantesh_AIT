                                         <b>Still I Rise</b>
                                         
                                You may write me down in history

                                With your bitter, twisted lies,

                                You may trod me in the very dirt

                                But still, like dust, I'll rise.



                                Does my sassiness upset you?

                                Why are you beset with gloom?

                                'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

                                Pumping in my living room.



                                Just like moons and like suns,

                                With the certainty of tides,

                                Just like hopes springing high,

                                Still I'll rise.



                                Did you want to see me broken?

                                Bowed head and lowered eyes?

                                Shoulders falling down like teardrops.

                                Weakened by my soulful cries.
